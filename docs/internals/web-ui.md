# Web UI

## Primitives

Controls come from [`components/ui`](../../apps/web/src/components/ui).
[AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md#taste) says how to use and extend them.

Don't style a raw `<button>`, `<input>`, `<select>`, or `<textarea>` to look like a control a
primitive provides. Raw elements are right when the element isn't that control: semantic rows, tabs,
resize handles, swatches, editor surfaces, anything whose behavior or geometry differs by design.

## UI language

Read UI labels from `t` in [`i18n`](../../apps/web/src/i18n/index.ts), for example
`t.settings.rows.language.title`. Bootstrap installs messages before importing main, so module-level constants
can read `t` too. Only Chinese sessions load the separate zh-CN dictionary chunk.
Do not translate strings sent to the server, saved to storage, used as prompts, or compared as data.
For example, ChatView's `titleSeed` must still match ThreadTitleRegenerationService's `"New thread"`.
Annotate each Chinese namespace literal with `Messages["namespace"]` to catch extra keys there.
Keep English string leaves wide: do not use `as const`. Use typed functions for interpolation and plurals;
components assemble rich text. Modules under `i18n/**` must not import React, TSX files, or web modules
outside i18n, because bootstrap imports this small module graph before the UI.

## Styles

Style with Tailwind classes in the component that renders the element.

- Global CSS, in [`index.css`](../../apps/web/src/index.css) or any other stylesheet, is only for
  what classes on the owning component can't express: generated Markdown or imperative DOM, custom
  elements and shadow roots, animations, runtime theme variables, and browser or Electron
  integration.
- No `style={{ ... }}` or inline `<style>` for static values a class covers. Values computed at
  runtime are fine.
- Theme-only rules use `@variant dark` and `@variant light`, not `.dark` selectors.

## Composition

The composer banners are the reference.

- [`ComposerBanner.tsx`](../../apps/web/src/components/chat/ComposerBanner.tsx) exports one object
  of small slots. Slots own their classes, take `className`, and spread the rest of their props,
  merging classes with `cn`. Variants and density are props on `Root`. A slot that needs a control
  renders `Button`.
- [`ComposerBannerStack.tsx`](../../apps/web/src/components/chat/ComposerBannerStack.tsx) composes
  the slots and owns only stack behavior: priority, expand and collapse, dismiss transitions.
- Consumers are a few lines of slots, and the slots carry the styling:
  [`ComposerActivityStatus.tsx`](../../apps/web/src/components/chat/ComposerActivityStatus.tsx).

Build new UI the same way. Compose or extend a component instead of copying its markup and classes.
When a call site repeats a treatment another one already uses, make it a variant or a slot on the
shared component. A new composer banner or notice uses the `ComposerBanner` slots.
